```
### MongoDB Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Saumya101203/ChatAppWithChatbot.git

   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser```
  Then, run the following commands:
   ```bash
       cd server
       yarn
       cd ..
       cd public
       yarn
       npm install @chatscope/chat-ui-kit-react
       cd ..
```
4. *Start the development servers:*

```bash

```
Open another terminal window, navigate to the server directory, and start the backend server. Ensure MongoDB is running in the background:
